[Overview] --------------------

The "Panorama To Cubemap" script involves deployment of the panorama image of a sphere map with a 2x1 ratio onto 6 Cubemap images via Unity.
Panorama photos taken with the iPhone app "PhotoSynth" can be used as Unity backgrounds.
Additionally, you can automatically create Skybox for use with the background.

Unity 4.2.2/4.3.1 have been confirmed to work on Win/Mac.

[How to Use] --------------------

Operate as Unity's Editor script.
Copy the PanoramaToCubemap directory into the project.
It is structured as per the below.

[Assets]
  [PanoramaToCubemap]
    [Documents]
      PanoramaToCubemap_en.txt
      PanoramaToCubemap_ja.txt
    [Editor]
      PanoramaToCubemap.cs
    [Example]
      saitama_park_2048x1024.jpg

Of these, what you need is the "Editor" directory and the "PanoramaToCubemap.cs" file which is inside that directory.
Please do not change the name of the "Editor" directory.
If nothing else is needed, feel free to delete the other files.
As a sample, we have placed a panorama image in "saitama_park_2048x1024.jpg".

If you select [Window]-[Panorama To Cubemap] from the main menu, then the
Panorama To Cubemap window will be displayed.

In the top part, if you choose select, you will nominate a panorama image which was already imported as an asset.
"Direction" nominates the rotation angle of the horizontal direction, and "Texture Size" will nominate the texture size of the Cubemap to be outputted.
"Clear" will clear all nominated settings
If you push the "Convert" button and wait a while, then the image deployed in the 6 Cubemap images will be displayed as Front/Back/Left/Right/Up/Down.
The Cubemap image is stored in Assets/output_images.

If you push the "Create Skybox" button at the bottom of the window, Skybox materials are created from the texture of the generated Cubemap.
The Skybox is stored in Assets/output_materials.

If you push the "Create Cubemap" button at the bottom of the window, a Cubemap is created from the texture of the generated Cubemap.
The Cubemap is stored in Assets/output_images.
It isn't the case that the 6 textures outputted in the Cubemap are used as is, but rather an image is assigned which horizontally flips them respectively.
